# AsynchronousCA
Simple models for synchronous and asynchronous cellular automaton solving the density classification task.

Asynchronous cellular automata can exhibit computing dynamics with nice properties for time efficiency and reduced computation. This particular model was used to demonstrate excellent results for solving the density classification when evolving update rules via genetic mutation in an evolutionary algorithmic manner.
